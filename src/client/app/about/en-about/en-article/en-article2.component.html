    <h3>Voice spectrum and speech analysis </h3>
    <p>The acoustic technology is closely related to acoustics and mathematics. Not only do we need to understand the frequency range of speech, but also through speech spectrum analysis, we can obtain the principle of multichannel array skin listening technique. </p>
    <p class="title">a."Energy time domain" and "frequency - energy - time domain" diagrams </p>
    <p>General voice information can be saved by computer microphones. Wav files, as shown in figure 8a, are a "energy-time-domain" graph. The Fourier transform can then be transformed into a "frequency-energy-time domain" graph, as shown in figure 8b. We see a figure 8. A difficult to distinguish the voice signal the differences between them, but if we look at the figure 8 b when it is easy to distinguish these different, this is because in this diagram a frequency distribution information. </p>

    <p>As you can see in figure 8b, the frequency of "one" in Chinese is mainly distributed between 500Hz and 2k -4k, and because there is no sound mother, there is little change in pronunciation. The frequency of Chinese "2" is mainly distributed under 2kHz, because there is no sound mother, it changes little in pronunciation. The middle state is clearly visible from "one" to "two". The "three" is clearly divided into two parts of the part of the mother and the part of the verse. The finals can be seen near 5kHz and the energy gap is visible near 2kHz. The part of the rhyme is able to see the visible energy distribution structure, with the obvious common characteristics of "one" and "two". Due to the more obvious characteristics, we in the 4 channel skin-hearing experiments, the frequency points is set to 400 hz and 400 hz, 1.6 kHz, 3.2 kHz, can easily distinguish between "one", "2", "three". However, because the frequency points are very sparse, there are also some differences between the sounds, such as "four" and "ten".
      In fact, we were carried out for many voice spectrum analysis, such as Chinese "you and I him", "father", "mother", "ten", as shown in figure 8 c, Chinese pinyin of "a g e y o u b u p m f k h j q x z c s useful ch sh", etc. After analyzing the spectrum of speech, we can distinguish the meaning of speech from the observation of the graph. </p>
    <p class="title">b.The first generation of the skin to listen to the second generation</p>
    <p>The first generation of skin listening devices has only one channel, so they can only identify the "energy-time-domain" information and cannot identify the frequencies. In the second generation of skin-hearing apparatus, we use the multi-channel filtering technology, one of each channel is independent of "energy - time domain" sensor, so the second generation of skin-hearing device has the ability to distinguish the frequency. We use the second generation of skin-hearing implement listening to the sound as we use eyes to observe the speech spectrum diagram, which is the second generation of skin-hearing device and analyze the principle of voice. The auditory cortex may be the same, but it hasn't been proven. But in practice the second generation of skin listening is limited to the ability to distinguish the frequencies. In particular, the number of channels can be distinguished by the number of channels, and the frequency points corresponding to each channel should be properly distributed. We believe that the four channels are too rough and should be at least 12 channels, and these points should be in the range of 300 hz ~ 3.2 kHz. </p>
    <p class="title">c.The frequency range of the sound and the frequency range of Chinese speech </p>
    <p>The frequencies of sound are wide, 20Hz ~ 20kHz. It is worth exploring how often our frequency resolution is able to identify the voice information we use daily. After our speech bandpass filtering experiment, the frequency range of Chinese phonetic speech only needs to consider 300Hz ~ 3kHz. With this range, the study of the analysis of the sound techniques of the skin has become more realistic.
      The use of four channels of skin listening devices can clearly distinguish many sounds, such as Chinese "one", "two", "three", "four" and "five". The frequency point is 400 Hz, 800Hz, 1.6 kHz, 3.2 kHz is better than 500 Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz. The Chinese "five" is particularly dependent on low frequency points, as shown in figure 8c.
      We in the frequency of 400 Hz and 800 Hz, 1.6 kHz, 3.2 kHz has carried on the elaboration, on the basis of the 12 channel experiment, we use the frequency of 317 Hz and 400 Hz and 504 Hz and 635 Hz, 800 Hz and 1008 Hz and 1008 Hz, 1600 Hz and 2016 Hz and 2016 Hz and 3200 Hz and 3200 Hz. After using 12 channels, are easy to distinguish between "one", "2", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight" and "nine", "ten". This also means that it is important to increase the frequency points within the critical frequency range. </p>
