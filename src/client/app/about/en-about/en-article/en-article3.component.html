    <h3>The relationship between skin structure and the sound of the skin</h3>
    <p>We also looked at a large amount of physiological literature, and discussed the physiological mechanism of acoustic electroconversion. In fact, the theory of the sound of the skin can be fully explained by the anatomy of human skin. </p>
    <p>Human skin can be divided into three parts: epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Which the epidermis thickness is about 0.1 mm (associated with specific location, age, gender), including the corneous layer, granular layer and stratum spinosum, base layer, corneous layer water content, less resistance is larger (about 500 k), of low voltage electric current has certain ability of impedance, in fact in all parts of the skin resistance can also be measured directly by multimeter. Leather thickness of 1 ~ 3 mm or so, can be divided into the papillary layer and reticular layer of dermis and papillary layer and jagged sample connection to the skin, contains abundant capillaries and lymphatic MAO, and the free nerve endings and cystic nerve corpuscles, internal is rich in blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerves and muscles. Subcutaneous tissue also contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. In the skin sensory nerve and motor nerve, through their contact with the central nervous system, can produce all kinds of feelings, muscular activity and finish all kinds of nerve reflex. The nerves of the skin are dominant, but there is a partial overlap between adjacent segments. Nerve fibers in the skin are distributed in dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Human knowledge of skin is not comprehensive, and there are many theories that need to be driven by practice. The sound of the skin is first discovered in practice, and its continuous improvement is the perfect process of physiological theory. </p>
    <p>Skin feeling ability for current signal can be interpreted as: human skin dermis is rich in nerve endings in distribution, the nerve endings were can receive various stimulus signal, at the same time also can upload various sensory signals in the current way of the cerebral cortex. Our further experiments revealed that the skin of the human cheek, finger, and forearm has the ability to listen. </p>
    <p>Through skin-hearing also explains evolution theory: the original simple animal without hearing ability, due to escape hunters need to evolve out of the first listen to the sound of the organ - single channel skin-hearing. Later, due to the higher animal hunting, evade the hunting and the demand of the mating process for sound animal characteristics can be more detailed analysis, and judgment, slowly evolved the multichannel sound - ears listening to the sound. Different animals, depending on the structure of the ear, have a different range of frequencies. Ear for receiving voice frequency range is about 20 ~ 20 KHZ, but resolution will vary from person to person, some people in voice frequency resolution is poor, not good singing, called'm tone-deaf. </p>

      The anatomy of the cochlear and cerebral cortex
    </p>
    <p>The multichannel array of skin sounds is basically the same as the sound of a person's ear. The ability of the ear to distinguish the sound frequency is produced in the cochlea, which is an efficient multichannel bandpass filter. The cochlear implant is very complex and is limited to the length of the human ear. Although the human ear is very complicated, but in addition to the auditory nerve of the cerebral cortex, other functions can be performed by electronic technology, such as acoustoelectric conversion, audio amplification, bandpass filter, etc. Is there any other passage to the cerebral cortex besides the auditory nerve? The answer is yes, it's not only there, but it's very rich, it's the skin that's all over our bodies. As shown in figure 14, the sensory center handles the various signals sent by the sensory nerve of the skin, which is much larger than the area of the auditory center. As you can see here, there is a huge potential for the use of skin sensory resources. </p>

    <p>We studied the multichannel array type skin-hearing technology is to the body skin sensory nerve as a certain position of cochlear basement membrane (cochlear anatomical term), is the use of human skin identification as shown in figure 8 "- energy - time domain frequency" figure. Facts have proven that through training the function of the human body each partition of the cerebral cortex can be mutual transformation, such as deaf sign language, identify with the hand of the blind braille skilled, etc. </p>
