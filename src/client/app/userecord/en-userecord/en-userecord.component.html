  <h2>The practice of adolescence </h2>
  <div class="detail">
    <h4>A small batch trial was implemented in the special education school in xianyang city on February <span>23</span>, <span>2006</span>.</h4>
    <p>In development of skin-hearing device at the same time, we have been teaching school and xianyang special maintain close cooperation, they not only provide us with the deaf sign language translation, and asked us for production as soon as possible to a group of good effect and the appearance of beauty products in their school, but due to problems such as shortage of funds, until the beginning of 2006 to make out a few simple skin-hearing, beautiful appearance will need more money. </p>
    <p>At the time, the skin sound organ was made of a hearing aid, which was large, unaesthetically pleasing, and was not equipped with a rechargeable battery, which cost more. Students can raise hand to reply immediately when call the student's name, in fact they are hearing through the skin and lipreading completed at the same time, also shows that the effect of skin-hearing device is obvious. On March 13, 2006, we conducted a small batch trial summary, and found that many of the practical problems are difficult to popularize the skin listening device: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The students were not able to find the point causing the signal to be uncomfortable and unstable </li>
      <li>Because of deaf children for a long time no voice signal, are used to sign language, so there is no voice, the concept of no for the urgent request of sound signal </li>
      <li>The experiment equipment is not perfect, only simple tape recorder, no such as VCD, TV, electronic instrument and other supporting equipment </li>
      <li>Traditional sign language teaching and a lot of social engagement have been used throughout the course of the process, with little time for the trial and training of the skin listening device </li>
      <li>Unable to communicate with normal people, deaf students lack a lot of common sense, they will stick the back of the electrode on the skin, and they will not be able to replace the electrode in time </li>
      <li>During the use of the process, the deaf student continuously adjusts the switch by hand and affects the normal work </li>
      <li>Because of the lack of knowledge, some parents have doubts about the safety of their skin </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>On January <span>7</span>,<span>2008</span>, at the special education school in xianyang city, a more formal use of deaf students was conducted </h4>
    <p>By the project proposal, due to xiaoming, responsible for the contact of shaanxi college of traditional Chinese medicine experts and professors to participate, on January 7, 2008 in xianyang special education school have made a trial. On January 7, 2008, 9:30 in the morning drive to xianyang special education school, arrive at 10:00 p.m. xianyang special education school, provided by the xue-jun han is responsible for the test of specific location, special education school in xianyang conference rooms, the location shall be the responsibility of the YanRunYing called deaf students. A total of seven deaf and dumb people participate in the trial, including one faculty six students, shaanxi college of traditional Chinese medicine surgery expert houchun-ming responsible for camera, project director also carried a digital camera for video recording. </p>
    <p>The project leader made a brief explanation and then began to try it. The project manager was only prepared to try 4 sets, and the other two were to be used by han xuejun and yan runying, and yu xiaoming had another set. With the advice of other experts, seven sets of deaf students were left for trial, so three deaf students were added. Began to try some of the students have begun to feel glad to, but some of the students obviously felt a stabbing pain, after repeated trial, to find the right position, all the students to accept. </p>

  <h2>The practice of deaf people in old age</h2>
  <div class="detail">
    <h4>Patient information</h4>
    <p> Ye ZheWen,She was born on December 28, 1948, at the age of 57, in elementary school, in the southern suburb of xi 'an, home to women. </p>
    <h4>The clinical situation</h4>
    <p>Ears deaf for up to three years, many years ago to a with residual hearing ear surgery, the two ears completely lost to listen to, now can't hear any sound, can read, can speak, not very fluent, and through writing and normal communication. </p>
    <h4>Wearing effect</h4>
    <p>On May 26, 2006 (Friday), Ye Zhewen introduced began using a hearing aid (originally was) skin-hearing, to June 10, 15, 2006, the jian-wen li pays a return visit, the use of get the following results: she often wear skin-hearing at ordinary times, can hear people talk, but listen to don't understand the meaning. As long as there was a movement around her, she could hear, and she thought that the skin sounded. In fact, the skin tone doesn't make any sound, just producing an audio current, and no feeling of tingling in the skin. In life, the sound organ of the skin gives her some convenience, if she can hear the sound of the water, help her to do the housework. Once she wears skin-hearing heard a great voice at home, but can not find a cause to sound at home, to just know is somebody else's house in the street shooting. At home, she was able to judge the cause of sound, such as a knock on the door after school. But when it comes to the street, it is difficult to judge what the noise is because of the noise. </p>
    <p>On December 28, 2007, we replaced the first generation of skin listening devices that we produced.</p>

  <div class="detail">
    <h4>Patient information</h4>
    <p> Su YuPing,She was born on February 19, 1936, in the department of mechanical department and department of the northwest light industry college. </p>
    <h4>The clinical situation</h4>
    <p>Language expression ability is very strong, because gallstones op (gall bladder calculi surgery not removed), pain after the operation, increase eat painkillers, uncontrollable coughing pain later play with atropine, causes the sharp decline in hearing, ringing in the ears is very severe, so much so that she could not hear the voice of the outside world, including others speak, until can't normal communication in recent years. For deaf, has bought a lot of hearing AIDS, a total of more than 10000 yuan, no one can play a role, some hearing AIDS special power, makes her hearing becomes worse, so she didn't want to wear. </p>
    <h4>Wearing effect</h4>
    <p>On Dec. 31, 2007, she tried the skin listening device for the elderly. When you start to wear your skin to hear a sound, you feel the same discomfort as the flat electrodes don't move in the right place. Then I found the right place, and there was no discomfort. Note that the relationship between the surface electrode and the posterior acupoint of the ear is very dense, and it is also easy for every normal person to experience it. After wearing the skin to listen to the sound organ, the old man can clearly feel the other person's speech, but can't understand the meaning of the other person at the moment. , of course, if you want to understand others speak you must go through a long time of training, maybe gears, maybe a few years, because people's understanding of language is a quite a long time. Physiologically, the skin can also will sound signals to the cerebral cortex, but it passed by the cerebral cortex and ear position is different, and characteristics also have the difference, so the brain must explain it further establishes a set of programs. </p>

  <h2>For the first time, try 12 channels of skin listening</h2>
  <div class="detail">
    <p>On March 26, 2013 about 2:30 in the afternoon drive to xianyang special education school, peers are jian-wen li and three graduate students Li Shasha, li yan, professor zhang, xianyang teachers and special education school by the vice President of xue-jun han Yan RunYing reception. </p>
    <p>Using the VCR, Mr. Li took notes.</p>
    <p>Wear a 12 channel skin-hearing device for the first time Wang Xue students can be found that the accuracy of speak Chinese "one", "2", "three", "four", "five", when we feel very surprised. In order to discover the real situation, we try shut off and open the power switch of skin-hearing method, found a residual hearing Wang Xue classmates, then we shut off again and again and open skin-hearing validated the power switch, the conclusion is: Wang Xue classmates have significant residual hearing, to compare accurate speak Chinese "one", "2", "three", "four", but without using 12 channel skin-hearing device (power off) can't say "five", when using 12 channel skin-hearing apparatus (open source) can say exactly when the "five". It also shows that the low frequency of the cochlear implant in wang xue's classmates is serious. </p>
    <p>The other students were relatively older, and they were able to tell their teachers in sign language, but they couldn't say it. Because of the long absence of speech, the vocal organs can't coordinate and the action of the speech is difficult to complete. It's easy for our normal people to speak, because we often use these movements, and the organs can work together. Some patients with a cerebral thrombosis are not able to speak clearly because of poor vocal coordination. It seems that speech is not all about the problem of speech, but that the ability to distinguish speech should also be trained for a long time. </p>
